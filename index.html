        <h2 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1" id="Stuck-On-My-Psijic-Quest">Lost in Time: A Psijic Apprentice’s Struggle</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">January 17, 2024 by Sephia Sky</p>
        <p>Hi everyone! I'm so excited to share with you a story about my journey to <a href="https://alcasthq.com/eso-psijic-order-leveling-guide/">level up the Psijic Order skill line</a> in Elder Scrolls Online. It was a crazy adventure that took me months to complete, and I learned a lot along the way.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The Psijic Order is a mysterious faction of mages that can manipulate time and space. They have some awesome abilities that can help you in combat, exploration, and crafting. To unlock their skill line, you have to complete a series of quests that take you all over Tamriel and beyond.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I started this questline with one of my characters, but then I got distracted by other things in the game. I decided to take a break from the Psijic Order and focus on other aspects of ESO. I thought I could resume the questline anytime I wanted, but boy was I wrong!</p>
        <blockquote> 
        <p>When I tried to get back to it, I realized that I had no idea where I left off. The quest was not in my journal, and I couldn't find any clues or markers on the map. I searched everywhere in Summerset Isle and Arteum, the two main locations of the Psijic Order, but nothing. I was stuck!</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I was desperate for help, so I turned to the internet. I asked on Steam forums, searched online, and posted on ESO forums, but nothing. No one seemed to have the same problem as me, or they didn't know how to solve it. I felt like giving up.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>But then, something amazing happened. I remembered that the NPC who gave me the quest also gave me a map item. A map item that I had completely forgotten about! I checked my inventory, but I couldn't find it. Where was it?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Then it hit me. The map item was not in my regular inventory, but in a special tab called Quest Items. A tab that I had never used before! I opened it, and there it was: the Psijic Map. I right-clicked on it, and it showed me where to go next. I was so happy!</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I followed the map, and it led me to the next quest giver. From there, it was smooth sailing. I completed the rest of the questline without any problems, and finally unlocked the Psijic Order skill line. It was such a relief!</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I hope you enjoyed my story, and maybe learned something from it. If you ever want to level up the Psijic Order skill line, don't forget to check your Quest Items tab! You never know what you might find there.</p>

        <h2 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1" id="Player-Issues-With-MMORPG">The Grind, the Lag, and the Rage Quit: MMORPG Realities</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">January 15, 2024 by Sephia Sky</p>

        <p>Hey, fellow gamers! Today I want to talk about a problem that many of us face when playing mmorpgs: the game's lifespan. How many times have you invested hours, days, or even months into a game, only to see it die out, lose players, or become a cash grab? I know I have, and it sucks.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>One of the main issues with mmorpgs is that they are designed to keep players hooked for as long as possible, but they often fail to deliver on their promises. They promise us endless content, epic adventures, and social interactions, but they end up being repetitive, boring, and isolating. They make us pay for everything, from cosmetics to inventory space to power-ups, and they don't care about the quality of the game or the feedback of the players. They just want to squeeze as much money as possible from us before moving on to the next project.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Another issue is that mmorpgs are constantly evolving and changing, but not always for the better. Sometimes they introduce new features or updates that break the game, make it unbalanced, or ruin the fun. Sometimes they remove features or content that we loved, or change the core mechanics of the game without warning. Sometimes they just stop updating the game altogether, leaving it in a state of decay and neglect.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>This leads to a situation where our gaming life outlives our mmorpg. We grow attached to our characters, our guilds, our friends, and our memories, but we have no reason to keep playing the game. We feel bored, frustrated, or betrayed by the game developers. We lose interest in the game, or we move on to another one. We leave behind a part of ourselves that we can never get back.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I think this is a sad and unfortunate reality of mmorpgs, and I wish there was a way to prevent it. I wish there were more games that respected their players, that offered meaningful and engaging content, that listened to their feedback, and that cared about their longevity. I wish there were more games that made us happy, not addicted.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>What do you think? Do you agree with me? Have you ever experienced this problem with mmorpgs? How do you cope with it? I'll be posting this on my <a href="https://twitter.com/sephia_sky">Twitter</a> account, let me know your comment. Thanks for reading!</p>
